          Hello there! I'm DJ, a web developer, and a graduate of the UCLA Extension Full-Stack Web Development Coding Bootcamp. During the class, I learned a lot, and very fast! We focused on JavaScript, and I learned to use Node, Express, React, MySQL, MongoDB, and so much more. I gotta say, I've really enjoyed learning about how the internet thinks!
          </h5>
          <h5 className="text-white mb-5" style={styles.main}>
          Before I decided to jump into the world of coding, I was living in New York City pursuing a career as an actor and working as a server (an actor working as a server? Never...) at Ellen's Stardust Diner. I wasn't just an ordinary server, I was a SINGING server. That's right, while I would go off to fetch your Coca-cola, I would come back with a microphone in my other hand belting out 50's songs and showtunes. It was a fun time! Once the world kinda fell into a dark pit of despair (you know what I'm talking about), I realized that I wanted stability and structure in my life. 
          </h5>
          <h5 className="text-white mb-5" style={styles.main}>
          Within 3 months of graduating my bootcamp, I was fortunate enough to get a Jr. Frontend Developer job at a company called InvestCloud! The job is going very well, and after only 5 months of employment, they asked me to become a mentor for other developers in the company! I canâ€™t wait to see what the future holds and where this new career path will take me! Please enjoy looking through my portfolio of projects I've worked on!
